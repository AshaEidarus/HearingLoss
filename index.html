  <h1> Hearing Loss and Deafness</h1>
</body>

</html>

<h2> What is hearing loss? </h2>

</p>Deafness is usually the result of inner ear or nerve damage. It can be caused by a condition present at birth.
Age-related wear and tear commonly causes hearing loss. Other causes include injury, disease, some medicines and loud
noises.
People with deafness hear little to no sound.
For some, surgery or using a hearing device might make some hearing possible. Lip-reading skills, written or printed
text, and sign language can help with communicating.<p>

  <h3> How does hearing loss affect a person's life </h3>
<p>Hearing loss makes the brain work faster causing it to strain to hear and fill in the gaps. It can also cause the aging brain to shrink more quickley. Hearing loss can also affect a person's mental health and behavior.It can also put you at greater risk for developing mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. In fact, hearing loss and depression in older adults go hand in hand. It affect behavior also because children who are deaf and hard of hearing are at higher risk of adverse social and emotional development which may lead to disruptive behavioral problems.<p>
